# Data Science Portfolio
This is a compilation of all the data analysis and machine learning projects I have worked on for academic and self-learning purposes.

### Machine Learning

<br />

[Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20Loan%20Defaults)

<b>Using prediction models to determine who may or may not default on their loans</b>

- Conducted feature engineering to pick the optimal predictors
- Ran features through multiple models to find the highest prediction rate to find traits that might lead to defaulting on loans

<br />

[Diabetes Prediction in Pima Indians](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction%20in%20Pima%20Indians)

<b>Used machine learning algorithms to create an optimal prediction model for cases of diabetes in a population of Pima Indians</b>

- Conducted feature engineering of necessary features for the prediction models 
- Ran features through multiple models to find the highest prediction rate to find traits that might help in predicting diabetes in patients

### Natural Language Processing

<br />

[Product Review Analysis](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Product%20Review%20Analysis):

<b>Created word clouds using NLP libraries (TextBlob, WordCloud and CountVectorizer) to find out which Amazon products are performing well</b>
  - Engineered features from the text of each product to quantify their values
  - Figured out the polarity in reviews and recommendation percentages of various products

### Data Analysis & Visualization

<br />

[airBnB NYC](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/airBNB%20NYC%20Price%20Prediction) : 

<b>Conducted an extensive data analysis based on: </b>
- frequency of properties in each neighbourhood of NY
- neighbourhood listings
- Pricing per neighbourhood
- Type of rooms 
- Minimum stay per guest
- Who hosted the guests


<br />

[Appointment No Shows](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Appointment%20No-Shows) :

<b>Conducted an extensive data analysis and cleanup </b>
- Computed total no-shows to appointments
- Analyzed the following to find patterns of cancellations: 
  - age
  - gender
  - symptoms
  - whether the patient received an SMS or not 
  - how long of a wait was it from the scheduled appointment
  - Time

[Misc Notebooks](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/misc_notebooks/)

<b>Smaller projects that I use to learn the important components to be applied in bigger projects</b>
