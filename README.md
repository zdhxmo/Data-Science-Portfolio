[Product Review Analysis](https://github.com/darkMatterChimpanzee/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Product%20Review%20Analysis):

<b>Created word clouds using NLP libraries (TextBlob, WordCloud and CountVectorizer) to find out which Amazon products are performing well</b>
  - Engineered features from the text of each product to quantify their values
  - Figured out the polarity in reviews and recommendation percentages of various products
